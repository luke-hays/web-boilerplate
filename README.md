Frontend TODO:
Spinner animation
Theme
MEAN Setup
Deal with hardcoded backend address
Styling on ErrorBoundary page (maybe clean it up as well)

Backend TODO:
REST Implementation
MongoDB integration
There's more improvements to be made here most likely.

Setting up tests may be a good idea but really these are just mean to be quick templates to build a project out.

Could consider Infra as Code Solutions into here
Setting up templates for different cloud providers
maybe self hosting solution?

A "Vanilla" JS site has been setup - no SPA. This uses scss for styling. Still utilizing webpack though.

Need to consider:
Routing
Queries
Testing (This I might disregard - this template is more for learning the underlying concepts of all these frameworks and libraries Ive been abusing)
