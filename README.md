Frontend TODO:
Spinner animation

MEAN Setup
Deal with hardcoded backend address

Backend TODO:

There's more improvements to be made here most likely.

Setting up tests may be a good idea but really these are just mean to be quick templates to build a project out.

Could consider Infra as Code Solutions into here
Setting up templates for different cloud providers
maybe self hosting solution?
